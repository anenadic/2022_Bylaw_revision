# 2022 Bylaw revision
Repository to organise the 2022 revision of the bylaws

See the [Carpentries handbook](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html) for the current version of the bylaws.

## Bylaw revision workflow

This workflow uses a GitHub repository with a 'working' copy of the current Bylaws text to discuss proposed amendments. 
Changes are intially made to this 'working' copy before a final Pull Request is made to the Bylaws in the handbook.

* Create a new repository for the revision, called `20XX_Bylaw_revision`
* Add a copy of this `README.md` file and update it as needed
* Add a copy of the file with the *current* bylaws text from [the handbook repository](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/blob/main/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.md)
* Transfer any open issues from the previous revision repository as needed to this new repo
* Open new issues as needed, enabling dicsussions about them
  * Add appropriate labels
* Propose changes through Pull Requests to the file `bylaws.md` in this repository
  * One or several issues can be addressed per Pull Request
  * According to the bylaws, changes need a majority vote of the Executive Council, this can be done through up-voting the Pull Request
  * Merge each Pull Request when a majority of the Executive Council has voterd in favor
* Once all changes have been approved, prepare a Pull Request to [the handbook repository](https://github.com/carpentries/docs.carpentries.org/blob/main/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.md)
  * add a motion to approve the proposed amendments to the bylaws to the next Executive Council monthly meeting for formal approval of the amendments
  * merge this pull request once the motion has passed
* Publish a blog post on the amendments on the Carpentries' blog.
